    <section class="main">Hello. My name is Sam Huebschwerlen. I am in my last year of graduate school for computer
        science. My areas of focus in school have been Software Engineering and Cyber Security. My primary areas of
        interest, so far, are full stack web development using MERN stack technologies as well as development in Unity
        for augmented and virtual reality. I have experience with C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS and SQL.
        I don't have much real world experience yet in the industry, but I am looking forward to gaining experience and
        learning all that I can!<br><br>

    <section class="about">
        For my Software Engineering class I worked on this project for eight weeks with three other
        group members. The project was to work on code for one of MIT’s previous seasons Battlecode contests. Every year
        MIT creates a game map with different rules that act as a competitive programming challenge where the bots of
        one team plays against the bots of another team in numerous rounds to compete by managing resources and
        implementing offensive and defensive strategies you program into the bots.
        <br><br>
        All of the code was developed in Java and can be found at the github repository here:
        https://github.com/huebschwerlen/battlecode (Links to an external site.)
        All of the tests were written using Mockito and Junit.
        For version control we used Github. And managed team communication through Slack.
        <br><br>
        This project was a great opportunity to get an idea of what it would be like working collaboratively on a team
        in actual industry. Our teams were preselected and we alternated each sprint as to who would act as Project
        Manager. Each sprint was organized into user stories on a Trello board that we would be assigned by the current
        acting project manager and attempt to complete by sprint end.
        <br><br>
        Some sprints were more focused on implementing core behavior and strategy for the bots, while some focused on
        writing tests for the code we had written. We also focused a lot on refactoring the code, making it more
        concise, organized, readable, modular and less redundant. My team and I would also practice pair programming
        which was another great experience.
        <br><br>
        Out of all the projects I’ve worked on over the course of my program this is the one where I felt it most
        prepared me for what it might be like working as a real software engineer and was incredibly valuable in making
        me comfortable working, virtually with people I didn’t know.

                <p>
                    Hello. My name is Sam Huebschwerlen. I am in my last year of graduate school for computer
                    science. My areas of focus in school have been Software Engineering and Cyber Security. My primary
                    areas of
                    interest, so far, are full stack web development using MERN stack technologies as well as
                    development in Unity
                    for augmented and virtual reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have experience with C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS and SQL.
                    I don't have much real world experience yet in the industry, but I am looking forward to gaining
                    experience and
                    learning all that I can!
                </p>
                <div class="more-info">
                    <p>
                        For my Software Engineering class I worked on a project for eight weeks with three other
                        group members. The project was to work on code for one of MIT’s previous seasons Battlecode
                        contests. Every year
                        MIT creates a game map with different rules that act as a competitive programming challenge
                        where the bots of
                        one team plays against the bots of another team in numerous rounds to compete by managing
                        resources and
                        implementing offensive and defensive strategies you program into the bots.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All of the code was developed in Java and can be found at the github repository link below
                        in the projects section of the page.
                        All of the tests were written using Mockito and Junit.
                        For version control we used Github. And managed team communication through Slack.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project was a great opportunity to get an idea of what it would be like working
                        collaboratively on a team
                        in actual industry. Our teams were preselected and we alternated each sprint as to who would act
                        as Project
                        Manager. Each sprint was organized into user stories on a Trello board that we would be assigned
                        by the current
                        acting project manager and attempt to complete by sprint end.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some sprints were more focused on implementing core behavior and strategy for the bots, while
                        some focused on
                        writing tests for the code we had written. We also focused a lot on refactoring the code, making
                        it more
                        concise, organized, readable, modular and less redundant. My team and I would also practice pair
                        programming
                        which was another great experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Out of all the projects I’ve worked on over the course of my program this is the one where I
                        felt it most
                        prepared me for what it might be like working as a real software engineer and was incredibly
                        valuable in making
                        me comfortable working, virtually with people I didn’t know.

                    <p>In Battlecode, two teams of virtual robots roam the screen, managing resources and executing
                        different offensive strategies against each other. This was a eight week, group project
                        where we programed strategic offensive and defensive behavior with Java, for the bots.
